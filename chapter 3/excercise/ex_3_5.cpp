/*3.5: An election is contested by five candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5 and the voting is done by marking the candidate number on the ballot paper.
Write a program to read the ballots and count the vote cast for each candidate using an array variable count. In case, a number read is outside the range 1 to 5,
the ballot should be considered as a “spoilt ballot” and the program should also count the numbers of “spoilt ballots”.
