/*Improve the system design in Exercise 6.3 to incorporate the following
features:
(a) The price of the books should be updated as and when required. Use a private
member function to implement this.
(b) The stock value of each book should be automatically updated as soon as a
transaction is completed.
(c) The number of successful and unsuccessful transactions should be recorded for
the purpose of statistical analysis. Use static data members to keep count of
transactions. */
